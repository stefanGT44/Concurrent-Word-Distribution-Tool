# Concurrent-Word-Distribution-Tool
A JavaFX desktop application for concurrently computing the distribution of specified words in large directories/files and plotting the results on a graph. (Distribution - the number of times each word appears in a text file)

## Overview
The system functions as a pipeline that consists of several types of components working concurrently in conjunction.<br>
There are three types of components:
1. Input component - data entry point
2. Cruncher component - data processing
3. Output component - storing and visualizing results

The user can make multiple instances of each component and link them in a way he sees fit.<br>
Every component instance runs in its own thread and every component type has a dedicated <b>thread pool.</b><br>
Input components provide input to cruncher components, which then provide input to the output components.<br>
Component communication (data flow) is based on shared <b>blocking queues</b>. <br>
The architecture of the system makes it easy to integrate new types of components.<br>
Components and the main app follow the <b>MVC</b> design pattern.<br>

## Usage example

![Alt text](images/de4.png?raw=true "")<br><br>
Input 0 is linked to Cruncher 0 which is automatically linked to the default output component.<br>
Input 0 is active and currently reading one text file (see the blue label).<br>
Cruncher 0 is currently computing the distribution in three files that Input 0 has provided.<br>
Cruncher progress can also be monitored in the output component, if an item in the list has a prefix, then results for that file are not ready yet (cruncher still working).
<br><br><br><br>

![Alt text](images/de5.png?raw=true "")<br><br>
In this image the Input and Cruncher components have finished their work from the previous image.<br>
The output component is showing the distribution of words in the file wiki-7.txt.<br>
It is also currently computing the sum distribution that the user specified.<br><br><br><br>

![Alt text](images/de6.png?raw=true "")<br><br>
In this example the output component is computing the specified distribution sum and is waiting for the final file results to become available to finish.

## Component details:
Every component instance runs in its own thread and every component type has a dedicated thread pool for completing its main tasks.<br>
Components communicate among each other using blocking queues. Every component has a blocking queue that its predecessors can write to.<br>

### Input components:
Every input component can be linked to one or more cruncher components.<br>
Every input component "produces" objects (read text) that one or more linked cruncher components "consumes".<br>
The main objective of input components is to scan directories for text files, read them and supply crunchers with them.<br>
Reading of text files is done in a separate task within the input thread pool.<br>
Input components are tied to a disk (drive) that the user specifies when creating a new instance. <br>
Only directories on the specified disk can be scanned, and only one reading task can be active in the thread pool per disk. <br>
After one scan cycle is finished, the component pauses for a certain duration before the next cycle (specified in the config file). <br>
The user can manualy pause and resume input components. <br>
The last modified value of scanned directories is tracked, so if a directory has been modified, it is scanned again (the text files are read again). <br>

### Cruncher components:
Every cruncher component "consumes" objects that one or more input components "produced".<br>
Every cruncher component "produces" objects that one or more linked output components "consume". <br>
Every cunrhcer instance has a specified arity number.<br>
If arity = <b>1</b> the cruncher counts the number of times every <b>single</b> word appears in a text,<br>
if arity = 3 the cruncher counts the number of times every 3 consecutive words, in exactly that order, appear in a text , etc.<br>
